Essay Classifier in C++
Overview

This is an essay classifier program using a perceptron in C++. The program takes in essays as inputs and generates a heat map to classify each essay based on common words. I used this program to find essays that were writen with GPT.



Input Format

The essay classifier program expects input essays in plain text format, with each essay represented by a separate file. The essays should be stored in a folder named "input" in the same directory as the executable.

Output

The program generates a log file with heuristics for each file.
